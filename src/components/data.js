I’m originally from Farmington, CT, but my family is from the area and I’ve always considered myself a yinzer. Outside of CS, I’m a massive sports enthusiast (Go Steelers and Pitt sports!!) and play viola in Pitt’s Symphony Orchestra. Really excited to continue to help grow CSC and the CS program in general at Pitt this year!",

    bio: "Hello! My name is Nij Patel and I am the events coordinator for CSC this year. I am currently a junior studying computer science with a minor in business. I have always been interested in computer science academically, but I picked up a business minor to match my outside the classroom experience. I want to continue working in the intersection between the two as a software engineer. My freshman year I interned at Fidelity Investments and this past summer I interned at Prudential. Outside of compsci, I love playing video games (I know real unique for a CS major), collecting sneakers, and watching Philly sports (forever salty about the Eagles, Phillies, and Sixers). I also enjoy tutoring at my local Kumon back home! Feel free to reach out or shoot me a message at any of the socials -  I’d be happy to connect!",
